# Cheetah
Cheetah is a scalable static site generator. For simple sites, it generates pure HTML. For more complicated sites and apps, you can add JavaScript either through regular scripts or through [components](components.html).

## Installation

Cheetah is available as a Conda package [on Prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev/channels/cheetah/packages/cheetah) - add the `https://prefix.dev/cheetah` channel, and install it as `cheetah` (globally, for example, with `pixi g i cheetah -c https://prefix.dev/cheetah`). This is the recommended way to install it.

It's also available on the AUR as [`cheetah`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cheetah).

Next, move on to [getting started](/getting-started.html).
